## Framework Agnostic

Shoestrap is now a Framework-Agnostic theme. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is included and is currently the default CSS framework, but it can easily be switched to another framework.

Other frameworks can be included via a plugin. To see an example of how to build your own frameworks as plugins, we've already built [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) in a plugin.

<a class="button button-alert" href="https://github.com/shoestrap/shoestrap-foundation">Shoestrap-Foundation</a>

By installing and activating this plugin, the theme will use the styles, scripts and definitions of the new framework and disregard the pre-bundeled Bootstrap.
